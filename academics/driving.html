  <h1>Getting a Permit in GA</h1>
  	<p>Obtaining a permit in Georgia is a lot easier than one may think. In my personal experiences, it has actually taken a lot longer for me to get all of the neccessary documents than actually passing the test. </p>
  <h2>Requirements</h3>
  	<p>The first thing that you want to do when applying for a permit, is to know if you are eligible. In Georgia, you must be at least 15 years old and a legal resident of the state.</p>
  	<p>Next, you want to do make sure you have all of the documents needed<br/><br/><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>US Passport</li>
  		<li>School Certificate of Attendance (Can be picked up in an attendance office at school</li>
  		<li>Social Security Card</li>
  		<li>10 dollars</li>
  	</ul>

  <h2>Preparing for the Exam</h3>
  	<p>After obtaining all of these documents, you want to prepare for the exam by taking practice tests online. While there is one practice on the DMV site, the most helpful one that I've used is here: <a href="https://driving-tests.org/">https://driving-tests.org/</a> On this website, make sure to do the practice exam simulator multiple times, as this is extremely helpful for the test and avoids a lot of the time needed in order to read the handbook.</p>
  	<p>Preparing for the exam should not take too long and should only take a few days max if you refer to the website. Furthermore, you don't want to spend too much time preparing as your Certificate of Attendance may only be valid for a limited amount of time. After studying for the exam, make sure that you look at the hours that the nearest DMV center has and if it is open. This is important as their are usually long lines there if the center is open and it is not worth going all the way just to see that it's closed.</p>

  <h2>The Exam</h2>
  	<p>Before even taking the written exam, you will have a vision test where you will be required to read a few letters on a screen. As a result, make sure that you wear your glasses/contact if you have them. It is essential that you pass this part of the exam because if you don't, then you will not be able to take the written portion.</p>
  	<p>The next part of the exam is the written portion. This section is divided into two parts which includes symbols and what to do in certain situations. Both of these parts are 20 questions each. Now on the actual exam, you can only get 5 questions wrong per section and you can't skip any questions. This is different than the practice test website that I have suggested, but the content from that website is still the same than on what is on the exam. Also remember that on the exam, it will tell you if you got a question right or wrong after you submit each response.</p>

  <h2>My Exam Experience</h2>
  	<p>When I took the driving test for the first time (I passed on my first attempt), I didn't miss any questions on the first section, but I missed three on the second section.</p>
  	<p>These were the questions that I missed on the second question:</p>
  	<ol>
  		<li>What is Gore?</li>
  		<li>What is overdriving your headlights?</li>
  		<li>What should you do if you enter an intersection and the traffic lights turn yellow? (idk how I even missed this one)</li>
  	</ol>
  	<p>I forgot the answers that I put specifically but the correct answers are as follows:</p>
  	<ol>
  		<li>Gore - A triangular piece of land</li>
  		<li>Overdriving headlights - Going at a way too fast speed that you can't really see other objects at night.</li>
  		<li>This is pretty obvious. You should clear the intersection quickly (I accidentally put proceed with caution).</li>
  	</ol>
  	<small>Note: You may not have these same questions as the exam is different every single time</small>
  	<p>Other than those three questions, I got everything else correct and was able to pass the exam. Once you get your permit, remember your limitations and that you always need to drive with an adult. Also remember that you need to drive carefully, as any four-point violation will result in a temporary suspension of your permit. I would suggest that after you get your permit, you first learn how to drive in a parking lot for a few days/weeks and then drive in your neighboring area. After that, you should enroll in Driver's Ed (any of them that are DDS certified) so that you are prepared for other roads. Furthermore, this is also essential because you need this in order to prepare for your provisional license which I will update this website later when I get it this summer.</p>

    <p>In my opinion, getting a provisional license was actually easier than getting a permit. So, as I have promised in my permit blog, here are the steps in getting a provisional license in Georgia.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>Just like in getting a permit, make sure to gather all of the required documents. For a provisional license, there are actually a few more documents/requirements that you need to get which include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be at least 16 years old</li>
        <li>Have a permit for at least one year and a day</li>
        <li>Completed at least 40 hours of supervised driving (with 6 hours being at night)</li>
        <li>US Passport</li>
        <li>Insurance Card</li>
        <li>School Certificate of Attendance</li>
        <li>Social Security Card/Tax Records</li>
        <li>ADAP/EADAP certificate</li>
        <li>32 dollars</li>
        <li>A car that is in good condition</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before getting all of these documents, I suggest that you first schedule your road test. The DMV is often filled up with people taking the road test, so you may have to sign up weeks, if not months before, if you want a specific slot.</p>
    <h2>Vision Exam</h2>
      <p>Just like in the permit test, you must pass a vision test before you could proceed to the actual driving test.</p>
    <h2>The Driving Test</h2>
      <p>Ok, so now it's finally time to take the actual test.</p>
      <p>You're probably breathing hard because this will determine if you get or don't get your license.</p>
      <p>But don't worry, you'll be just fine! For the driver's test, just make sure you listen to all of your proctor's instructions and follow all of the driving rules.</p>
      <p>What it really comes down to is how much you practice. The more you practice driving around, the more confident you should be about your abilities in driving.</p> 
      <p>Everyone's exam is going to differ based on my proctor and where the testing course is. So here is my personal experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>First, the proctor will go around the car and make sure that everything is working. This includes things like your turning signal lights, headlights, wipers, horn, and other things.</p></li>
        <li><p>After making sure my vehicle is safe to operate, my proctor told me to drive around a pre designed track at the DMV location. In this track, I was required to back up in a straight line, do a parallel parking, and perform a three-point turn.</p></li>
        <ol>
          <li><p>So for the backing up in a straight line, make sure you actually turn your head and look back when backing up. Also, make sure you keep your hand firmly on the steering wheel so you don't lose control if your vehicle starts turning. For this part, I recommend just releasing the brake. There's no need to press on the accelerator unless you really cannot back up without the extra power.</p></li>
          <li><p>Next, for the parallel parking, the first thing you need to do, just like in real life, is to signal your intentions of turning into the parking space. Next, depending on the size of your car, go a little bit forward from the space and then put your car in reverse. As you backup into the space, you need to slightly turn your steering wheel until you can see in your left side mirror the two cones that are behind the space. Then, you need to back up straight into the parking lot and then turn your steering wheel the other to straighten your vehicle. If you feel like your parking isn't straight, then you can make some adjustments by going back-and-forth. I recommend looking at <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Parallel-Park" target="_blank">this wikihow article</a> to understand how to parallel park visually.</p></li>
          <li><p>Lastly, for the three point turn (aka turnabout), you need to first give your car a good amount of room to back up into the space. So first, make sure you drive straight passed the space. Then once you have enough room, backup (DON'T forget your indicator) into the space and turn your steering wheel sharply. Once you backup into the space, your proctor will tell you to then drive away from the space for the real road test.</p></li>
          <li><p>If you want to get more practice with the track, then I <b>STRONGLY</b> recommend heading to your nearest DMV and practicing at the track if it's available. In my case, I didn't have to schedule any appointment to practice at the track so it was good for preparation.</p></li>      
        </ol>

        <li><p>Ok, for the last part of the exam, I had to drive in real traffic. For me, this was the easiest part of the exam for me since I was used to driving on the streets. Everyone's track may differ from what I drove on but most of the time, it's usually just around the block. During the test, just make sure to follow basic driving rules, like make a complete stop at the stop sign, stop at a red light, drive under the speed limit. As long as you follow the rules and listen to your proctor, you should have no problem passing this portion and walking out with your license!</p></li> 

      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So in conclusion, my actual driving test only took like 15 minutes. In the end, if I remember correctly, I got a final score of 86%. I got a few points off for braking too hard and not giving a turn signal at one point.</p>
        <p>But in the end, your final score on the test doesn't really matter as long as you get the 75% needed to pass. After all, every time you drive is a test making sure you can handle your vehicle safely and follow of the rules of a defensive driver.</p>

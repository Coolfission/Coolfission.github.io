Well, it's finally the beginning of August. 

And wow! Things have not gotten better at all. 2020 has definitely been a crazy year.

First of all, US COVID cases are up and there isn't a single sign that it is going to decrease anytime soon. I still can't believe that we're in August and we're still battling the virus. It's really a shame that even after 6 months, the number of cases aren't decreasing or even remaining stable. In fact, cases are increasing the death rate is also starting to increase again.

    <p>Well, it&#39;s finally the beginning of August. </p>
  <p>And wow! Things have not gotten better at all. 2020 has definitely been a crazy year.</p>
  <p>First of all, US COVID cases are up and there isn&#39;t a single sign that it is going to decrease anytime soon. I still can&#39;t believe that we&#39;re in August and we&#39;re still battling the virus. It&#39;s really a shame that even after 5 months, the number of cases aren&#39;t decreasing or even remaining stable. In fact, cases are still increasing and the death rate is also starting to increase again. </p>
  <p>Yet even after all of this, what I find really disapointing is the response of our leaders. Now, I&#39;ll admit, I really hate talking about politics, but people are really making the current situation a political thing and it really fills me up with anger seeing leaders like Donald Trump and Brian Kemp downplaying the virus as if it&#39;s nothing to worry about. </p>
  <p>For example, in the past few months, Trump said/did things like:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;It&#39;s only a couple of people coming from China&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;One day, the virus is going to disappear like magic&quot;</li>
  <li>Defunding the WHO</li>
  <li>Suggesting to inject yourself with disinfectant to combat the virus or taking hydroxychloroquine (which has been repeatedly tested to be ineffective)</li>
  <li>&quot;I do not take responsibility for the 100k Americans who&#39;ve died&quot;</li>
  <li>Preventing hospital data from being sent to the CDC </li>
  </ul>
  <p>And more recently, in response to the 150k deaths, he said:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>&quot;It is what it is&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, I&#39;ll admit, from my previous blog post, I also kind of thought that that people are overreacting about the coronavirus. However, I was saying this only because back in early April when I wrote that post, countries around the world were starting to make a steady recovery form the virus. Places like South Korea, New Zealand and most European countries like France were already passed their peak and declining in cases <strong><em>within</em></strong> a matter of 2 months. I can&#39;t believe that the countries behind the US in number of COVID cases are Brazil and India, which both have poor healthcare systems and a large population living in condensed areas. </p>
  <p>What I&#39;ve noticed especially in the countries that have successfully combated the virus is that they acted quickly and placed strict orders. For example, there was a federal mask mandate put in place, social distancing was enforced, and lockdowns were actually happened. Speaking of lockdowns, I remember in Georgia, we had a lockdown that only occurred for about 2 weeks. And not going to lie, it was a complete utter joke. Even though most businesses were closed, I still saw people going and hanging out with a large number of people, not caring about social distancing or wearing a mask. Moreover, it didn&#39;t feel like anyone was enforcing the lockdown either. </p>
  <p>Some lockdown is still better than having no lockdown at all. But after these two weeks, Governor Brian Kemp announced that lockdowns should be lifted and started beginning the phases for reopening. I was really astonished to hear that Kemp wants GA to reopen so quickly. Like cases were still rising and opening now would be a really bad idea. </p>
  <p>And just like that, Georgia started opening up and was probably the first state in the US to do so. And I guess we&#39;re really paying the consequences. As of August 8, there are now 4,029 deaths and 193k confirmed cases just in Georgia (in which the real numbers are probably 10-12x higher). </p>
  <p>What I really want to criticize in Kemp&#39;s actions though is definitely something he prohibited. Recently, Atlanta mayor Keisha Bottoms wanted to make masks mandatory, especially after she caught COVID-19 herself. However, the Governor, for some really weird reason, decided that making masks mandatory is too much and decided to sue anyone in Georgia who tries to make masks mandatory. When I heard about this, I thought I was hearing a joke or something. Literally, the governor of Georgia doesn&#39;t want to make a scientifically <strong>PROVEN</strong> and easy method of preventing transmission of coronavirus mandatory? More than that, he&#39;s trying to <strong>SUE</strong> people for making it mandatory? That&#39;s definitely one of the most foolish and illogical things that I&#39;ve heard during this entire pandemic. </p>
  <p>2020 really hasn&#39;t been a great year for anyone. It&#39;s crazy how many things have happened in these past few months and how much of the year is still left. However, I think everyone has learned important lessons in 2020 regarding humanity and society. First, it&#39;s obvious that we&#39;re not prepared for a pandemic at all. Once the current pandemic ends, I&#39;m sure people and businesses will continue to take extra precautions like disinfecting commonly-touched areas. Even when there isn&#39;t a pandemic, taking these extra precautions will prevent many people from getting sick and is safer for everyone in general. Secondly, I&#39;m glad that people in the US and internationally are really taking strong actions to protest against police brutality. Too many cases of unfair treatment and excessive punishments have occurred against African Americans simply because of their skin color. I&#39;m surprised that these problems still occur in the 21st century, but I&#39;m glad to see that more and more people want change to occur and to bring racial equality. And last and most importantly, I think the most important lesson from the pandemic and 2020 has to do with the environment. From the moment lockdown was put in place, the AQI has significantly decreased in countries all over the world. Places like the Himalayas were finally visible all the way from cities in the first time in 30 years. From this pandemic, I think everyone now understands how much of a deadly environmental impact humans have havocked on the globe. Hopefully, people will learn from this pandemic and take more actions to protect the environment to decrease the likelihood of things like Global Warming. </p>
  <p>So in essence, especially in these trying times, please remember to use trustworthy sources to get your information. Use websites like CDC for COVID-19 advice and for tips to stay safe. Listen to infectious disease experts like Anthony Fauci, who has <strong>DECADES</strong> of experience in this field. And now more than ever, don&#39;t listen to politicians like Trump or Kemp: they&#39;re only focusing on their re-election and making money. </p>
  <p>And lastly, please remember to wear your PPE, remember to vote, and stay safe. </p>

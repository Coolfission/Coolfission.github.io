Well, it's finally spring break! But it doesn't really feel like one...

I still can't believe that Thursday, March 12, 2020 would be my last day of high school. My senior year was going great so far and that day was just like any ordinary day for me. The previous two days of school were cancelled because someone got infected with coronavirus in south of Fulton County. However, I thought that it's no big deal and that the virus wouldn't spread too much. On that day, I still had my 6 classes as scheduled. I had my lectures in all of my classes, I had my quiz in APES, nothing out of the usual. Now because the previous two days were cancelled, some of my teachers were discussing about the possibility of online learning in the coming weeks. I thought it was a good thing they were discussing about the possibility of virtual learning, but I never knew that it would become a reality for the rest of the school year. When the bell rang at the end of 6th period, like any normal day, I walked to my car, said 'see ya' to my friends and drove home. Little did I know that that would be the last time I see many of my classmates before I head off to college.

So before I say the rest of how my day went, let's go back to when I first heard about this virus. I first heard about COVID-19 on the news on January 26. After hearing about it, I searched up the WHO and CDC to see what they knew about the virus as of that time. As I browsed the websites, a few things catched my interest. First, I heard the virus causes similar symptoms to pneumonia. Then I also learned that the virus originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 were it is believed to have spread from animal-to-human contact in one of the wet markets. Lastly, I learned that the virus has a different sequence of DNA from other coronaviruses so there is no cure for it. A few days later, a read on CNN about a live coronavirus tracking map from John Hopkins University:

Seeing that only a hundred people were infected, that too all in China, I thought it was nothing to worry about. I thought the virus would just be like Ebola where it was mostly contained in one area. Little did I know that the virus would soon become a global pandemic that would infect millions of people. Ok, so now let's get back to the rest of my last day.

So after I came home, I sat in front of my laptop preparing to play some League and Fortnite since school was supposed to be closed on Friday and Monday for teacher workdays. Then at 5:27 PM, I heard that Georgia State University is cancelled for the next two weeks. As soon as I read that, my mind started rushing. "If Georgia State got cancelled, then there is no way school isn't going to get cancelled," I thought to myself. Then just a little less than half an hour later at 5:52 PM, one of my friends texted me that schools are closed until further notice. "You're joking," I wrote as I quickly typed on my laptop. "Nope, you can check on fultonschools.org," my friend replied. I then went on my county's website and saw that the message is true.

Well those next few weeks of telelearning were pretty boring. Even though we were all stuck at home, I still had to do online school. Although I was used to having online classes since I take College English at GSU online, this was way worse because I had to attend live lectures and finish my work before the end of the school day (3:30). And also, it became pretty clear that in some of my classes, such as band, it was pretty much impossible to have teleschool (I'm pretty sure you can tell why). Nevertheless, in all of my classes, it was pretty hard for my teachers to get us engaged since we weren't meeting in person. However, like most of my classmates, I thought that this would only go on for like two more weeks and then we can get back to school.

So fast forward to March 26, and it was finally two weeks since the initial announcement from my county. This time, however, I was kind of skeptical of the chances of having school again. In the past few days since March 12, I have been looking at that map from John Hopkins University, and I clearly saw that the number of cases were only getting exponentially larger. And also a ton of my outside school activities and other events around the world got cancelled/moved as well which were:

      - FBLA State Leadership Conference
      - Science Olympiad State (which my school wasn't qualified to go to anyways)
      - My Band's New York Trip (which was going to be April 8-11, so I would literally be packing my bags to head off to NYC tomorrow)
      - IB Exams
      - USG colleges were to be online for the rest of the semester and summer
      - Olympics (got postponed to next year)
      - E3
      - Mobile World Congress
      - Coachella (postponed to October)
      - And so much more...

    So after hearing all of these things get cancelled and seeing the rising number of cases, I was pretty certain schools were to be cancelled. And so my thoughts were confirmed when the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, announced that all public schools were to be closed until April 24.

    But even after all of these things got cancelled, I was still pretty hopeful that prom, graduation, and AP Exams (I need that college credit you know) would still happen. Or if they get cancelled, then AT LEAST that we can come back to school eventually before the end of the year.
    
    But all of my hopes disappeared on April 1 when Kemp announced that schools would be closed until the end of the school year. After reading about this on AJC, I was ** * SHOCKED. * ** It has to be a joke I thought to myself. After all it was April Fools Day. It only took a few minutes for the message to spread around. I remember seeing hundreds of chats and posts from all of my friends saying how they're going to miss seeing me and each other. I also noticed some people sharing a video that one of the English teachers at my school made. Even though I never took his class, I still knew him since he was an advisor for some of my extracurricular activities. So I decided to watch the video and felt sad knowing my teachers will also miss seeing the Class of 2020:

    So now it is almost a week since Governor Kemp announced schools are closed for the rest of the year. Even after all of this time, I'm still wondering how many opportunities the world had to keep the virus from spreading.

    ##### What if China didn't try to censor the virus or the number of cases in the first place
    #### What if the WHO started taking stronger actions the first time they were notified
    ### What if the world banned transportation to and from China to stop COVID-19 from spreading
    ## What if the US acted faster and kept everyone in quarantine earlier
    # What if
    # What if ... 
    # WHAT IF ... ...

The truth is, there were so many chances to hinder the spread of coronavirus. But while some countries have taken action, others still haven't done so (or at least not to a good enough extent). So I'll admit, I'm not a medical expert myself, and I have no idea how viruses spread so quickly, but one thing is clear: we need to protect ourselves and other people. If there is one thing you learned from this blog post, it's not that I am upset since the rest of my senior year is cancelled. In fact, I actually consider myself to be better off than the underclassmen who aren't able to do their activities or are going to get behind in their schoolwork during this time of the year. It's actually that we can still unite together to fight this virus. I've read so many articles of doctors and univerisities around the world trying hard to find the cure, building equipment quickly, and making testing more readily available for those who need it. But what can we do, not being considered as an essential employee? Well there are many things we can do [(including contributing to the folding@home project)](https://foldingathome.org/), but here is one thing that everyone needs to do: We need to practice social distancing and quarantine ourselves in order to keep others and ourselves from getting infected. Think about it this way, the more we quarantine and self-isolate ourselves now, the faster we will be able to get back to our normal lives and keep other people from catching the virus and dying.
